The project aimed to develop a predictive model for bike demand in Seoul, South Korea, to improve the efficiency of the city's bike sharing system. The model considered factors like time of day, seasonality, weather conditions, and holidays to predict demand accurately.

Key findings include:

- Peak demand in the morning and evening, with lower demand in winter and highest in June.

The project's success demonstrates the potential of machine learning in optimizing bike sharing systems, leading to more efficient and sustainable urban transportation solutions.
